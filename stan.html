      <p>
        I founded STAN, a Supportive Triage Assistant which uses Machine
        Learning to help triage emergency department patients. To date, STAN has
        directly supported over 50,000 patients in New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm progressively writing the STAN story up on this page. It's pretty
        light on info right now so if you're hungry for more STAN content check
        out:
        <a href="https://wwww.stantriage.com">stantriage.com</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="image-caption">
        <i>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</i>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Triage</h3>
      <p>
        Triage is the process of prioritising emergency department patients.
        Emergency departments are unpredictable. Patients present with varying
        acuity, urgency and complexity. Demand for emergency resources often
        outweighs capacity meaning not all patients can be attended immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        So triage is super critical. <i><strong>But it's also hard!</strong></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Triage nurses make complex triage decisions in a short time period, and
        should avoid being influenced by environmental biases i.e capacity of
        the emergency department or the patients in the waiting room. Triage
        nurses operate unsupported; they conduct triage alone, are typically
        without electronic clinical support and are usually unable to ask for
        second opinions from their colleagues.
      </p>
      <h3>STAN</h3>
      <p>
        STAN supports triage nurses with machine learning and encoded clinical
        algorithm. For example, a nurse might triage the following patient:
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/example_presentation_sepsis_vitals_ex.jpg"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Example triage presentation"
      />
      <p>
        After making a triage assessment, STAN would offer information to the
        nurse in real time, something like the below:
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/platform_sepsis_new.jpg"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Example STAN presentation"
      />
      <h3>Does STAN positively impact triage?</h3>
      <p>
        We think so. Nurses regularly adjust their decision making due to STAN's
        recommendations (around 25% of the time when STAN recommends an opposing
        course of action).
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, a survey of 16 nurses using STAN at Nelson Marlborough District
        Health Board found that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>88% of nurses thought STAN improved triage consistency</li>
        <li>
          100% of nurses thought STAN helped junior nurses triage more
          appropriately
        </li>
        <li>
          88% of nurses thought STAN improved recognition and uptake of clinical
          pathways
        </li>
        <li>
          The majority of nurses thought STAN helped with Sepsis identification
          (88%), appropriate mental health triage (81%) and recognition of high
          risk symptoms (69%)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We are in the midst of publishing research to further showcase how STAN
        has helped support triage in New Zealand. So keep an eye out for this.
      </p>
      <h3>Is STAN a business or a research project?</h3>
      <p>
        We have decided not to pursue commercial use of STAN despite significant
        interest from around New Zealand. The simple fact is that
        (unfortunately) there are easier ways to make money than selling a niche
        decision support tool to the public health sector of a tiny island
        economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learnt a lot however, and do want to pay it forward. Keep an eye
        out for our research and get in touch if you are working on decision
        support tools and would like to chat: mackdelany [at] gmail.com
