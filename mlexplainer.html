      <h3>Setting the scene</h3>
      <p>
        In theory, software programs will do the same thing every time they run.
        This is because the actions they take are explicitly programmed.
        Opposingly, machine learning programs will attempt to improve their
        performance in relation to a goal as they gain experience. This is
        because only the goal is explicitly programmed, the actions they take
        are implicit. Most people think machine learning relies on fancy
        algorithms. That's maybe 40% true - while you need the algorithms, they
        aren't the fundamental driver of performance or what's possible. What
        matters is the data which the algorithms use to learn.
      </p>
      <h3>How to think about data</h3>
      <p>
        Loosely speaking, data is just stored information. In the real world, we
        can classify collections of data as either structured or unstructured.
        Machine learning can be applied with both structured and unstructured
        data - but it's important to understand the difference.
      </p>
      <h5>Structured Data</h5>
      <p>
        Structured data lives in a table consisting of rows and columns. For
        example:
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/structured_data_1.png"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Example of structured data"
      />
      <p class="image-caption">
        <i>You'll also hear 'tabular data' as a reference to structured data</i>
      </p>
      <h5>Unstructured Data</h5>
      <p>
        Unstructured data is everything that doesn't live in a table of rows and
        columns. But don't fret, just because it has less structure, doesn't
        mean we can't use it for machine learning. Common examples of
        unstructured data include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Voice recordings</li>
        <li>Documents (eg 1000s of PDFs)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>Machine learning programs fall into one of three families:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i><b>Supervised learning</b></i
          >, where our algorithm is given examples of the target answer we want
          to predict
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><b>Unsupervised learning</b></i
          >, where our algorithm doesn't have examples of the answer to learn
          from, but rather generates new findings from the data
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><b>Reinforcement learning</b></i
          >, where a machine is exposed to a new environment and asked to learn
          from trial and error
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Supervised learning is far and away the most utilized framework in the
        world today. If you're starting to look at potential applications of
        machine learning - then supervised learning should be your first port of
        call. Don't sleep on unsupervised learning though, it has specific use
        cases which we'll gloss over shortly. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning
        is a still-emerging framework currently most
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g"
          >well known for beating humans in complex games.</a
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Supervised Learning with Structured Data</h3>
      <p>
        It's all in the name, our model needs to <i><b>learn</b></i> how to find
        the target variable before it will <i><b>know</b></i> how to find the
        variable. The machine needs a dataset to learn from, and that dataset
        must contain the target variable. Let's pretend we're training an
        algorithm to predict an animal's maximum lifespan. We could use our
        dataset from before:
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/structured_data_2.png"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Example of structured data"
      />
      <p>
        Our algorithm would go to work examining the relationships between the
        yellow dependent variables and the green target variables. Once trained,
        we could test our robot on new data that it hadn't seen before.
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/structured_data_3.png"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Trained machine learning model"
      />
      <p>
        If our training data was good, then our algorithm will predict the
        maximum lifespan of an animal (our target variable) with a high degree
        of accuracy.
      </p>
      <h3>Supervised Learning with Unstructured Data</h3>
      <p>
        It's the same logic for images and other unstructured data. We can train
        a machine to look for something, but first, we need to tell it what to
        look for. Give an algorithm a few thousand labeled cat and dog photos,
        and it'll pretty quickly work out how to classify your local household
        animals.
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/cats_and_dogs.jpeg"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Cats and dogs"
      />
      <p class="image-caption">
        <i>Welcome to the most cliche machine learning example possible</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This applies for image sentiment, facial recognition, or any other image
        classification problem. Again, data quality is by far the most important
        contributor to success. Training the model is relatively easy given a
        high quality labeled dataset.
      </p>
      <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Unsupervised machine learning algorithms examine patterns in the data to
        identify new trends. A common example is clustering, where an algorithm
        will identify groups within the dataset that we weren't previously aware
        of.
      </p>
      <img
        src="static/imgs/unsupervised_learning.png"
        class="img-fluid centre-image"
        alt="Clustering"
      />
      <p>
        Unsupervised learning can be extremely useful in specific use cases.
        Well known examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting dangerous anomalies in an aircraft engine</li>
        <li>
          Clustering customers into different cohorts based on unique behaviors
        </li>
        <li>Detecting odd, and potentially fraudulent bank transactions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Reinforcement learning involves an algorithm in a dynamic environment,
        such as a video game or as the controller of an energy system. The
        algorithm is able to explore and try different actions - it is rewarded
        for positive decisions, and penalized for negative ones. In a general
        sense, reinforcement learning artificially replicates a human's ability
        to learn by trial and error.
      </p>

      <p class="image-caption">
        <i>Humans learn from their mistakes right?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although real-world applications are emerging, reinforcement learning is
        largely centered in the research world. The AlphaGo documentary is a
        fantastic watch for those interested in the accelerating development of
        reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <h3>Thinking about what's possible</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we've completed Machine Learning 101, we can start to think
        about potential machine learning applications.
      </p>
      <h5>X Marks the Spot</h5>
      <p>
        The first question to ask is, what's the target? What do we want to
        know? Some examples of target variables we could select:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature -> predicting daily maximum temperatures</li>
        <li>
          Species -> predicting what species an animal in a photo belongs to
        </li>
        <li>
          Price -> predicting what price will maximize profit from a product or
          business
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once we have a target, we can start to structure a relevant dataset. For
        example, if predicting temperature, we would gather historical weather
        data. Or if identifying species, we'd look for as many animal photos as
        possible.
      </p>
      <h5>Measuring uncertainty</h5>
      <p>
        It's easy to see there are limitless applications of machine learning.
        It's harder to tell which potential projects will be successful. After
        determining a target, new, harder questions emerge - to mention a few:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do we have enough data that accurately represents the target?</li>
        <li>
          Are there biases in our data which we don't want our model to learn?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will our algorithm perform better than a human? Does it need to?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you can imagine, these questions can rarely be answered at the outset
        of a project. But that doesn't mean they're not worth asking. It's
        important to understand the assumptions you're making before you commit
        to experimentation. However, while planning and risk assessment are
        important, you'll never know how successful your project is going to be.
        Or how long it will take. Or whether your data carries unwanted bias. At
        some point, you have to acknowledge the uncertainty and jump in. That's
        the fun part.
