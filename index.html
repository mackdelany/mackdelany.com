        Right now I'm in New Zealand building Machine Learning powered solutions
        for emergency medicine and carbon capture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I founded and built <a href="https://www.stantriage.com/">STAN</a>, a
        Supportive Triage Assistant which helps emergency clinicians prioritise
        patients. STAN has supported over 50,000 patients to date.

        I'm also a Machine Learning Engineer at
        <a href="https://www.carboncrop.nz/">CarbonCrop</a>. We use remote
        sensing, machine learning and good ole fashioned software to quantify
        carbon sequested by forests. We then provide landowners with access to
        carbon credits.
      </p>

        Past lifes? I've spent time in New York and Berlin working as a Product
        Manager for <a href="https://www.mish.guru/">Mish Guru</a>. And I
        studied studied Civil and Natural Resources Engineering at the
        University of Canterbury.
